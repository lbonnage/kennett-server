# On-Demand Minecraft Server for Kennett Group

Python Flask/AWS application, creates a website that can be used to launch an AWS EC2 instance to host a Minecraft server.  Users can request for the server to start through the webpage.  The server will shut down automatically after 15 minutes when there are no players, in order to reduce hosting costs.


## AWS Setup


## Web Application Deployment


## AWS Instance Configuration


## Goals
 - Choice of server to run
 - Current player count
 - If the server is already running it should tell you when you enter the password
 - Better security (maybe?)
